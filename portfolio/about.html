    <h2>Professional Background</h2>

    <p>
      I’m Eugene, a Senior Web Developer at Tech Innovators Inc., with over five
      years of experience in creating dynamic web applications. My journey began
      at StartupX, where I developed scalable solutions that significantly
      enhanced user engagement. Currently, I lead a team of developers, focusing
      on innovative and efficient web solutions.

    <h2>Personal Story and Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for technology started in college, where I built my first
      website. Outside of work, I love hiking and exploring nature. I’m also an
      active member of the local tech community, mentoring aspiring developers
      and participating in hackathons.
